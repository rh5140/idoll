# CameraSystem

Prefab for camera implementation. Can be switched between a player-follow camera (```PlayerCamera```) or a cutscene camera (```CutsceneCamera```). 

On Scene initialization, the default camera is ```PlayerCamera```.

```PlayerCamera``` must be initialized with a target GameObject to follow under the ```Follow``` SerializeField. 

â†’ To follow the player, ```PlayerSprite``` must be used, NOT the parent object ```Player``` itself.
